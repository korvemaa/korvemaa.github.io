# Welcome to my Astro Blog!

This is the **body** of my first blog post. Astro makes it incredibly easy to create content-driven websites, and Markdown is a fantastic way to write your articles.

## Key Features of Astro Blogging with Markdown:

*   **Frontmatter:** Define metadata like title, description, author, and tags directly within your Markdown file.
*   **Built-in Markdown support:** Astro handles the rendering of your Markdown content into HTML automatically.
*   **Content Collections:** Organize your blog posts and other content types for better structure and type safety.
*   **Layouts:** Apply consistent styling and structure to your blog posts using Astro layouts.

### Example Code Snippet:

You can even include code snippets in your Markdown:

```javascript
console.log("Hello from Astro!");

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));

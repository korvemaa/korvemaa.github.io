## Cloud and Automation

● Implemented Enviz's automation backend using Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) and various Azure cloud resources 
improving scalability and reliability with well over 6000 models processed through it and thousands of hours of combined 
processing time 

● Designed and developed a Blender/Python-based lightmapping pipeline for automated scene baking, including atlas generation 
based on object texel density, UV unwrapping, packing, and baking 

● Set up and maintained Docker containers for automation pipelines, enhancing deployment consistency and efficiency with zero 
downtime 

● Developed a custom file format and tooling to enabling fast streaming of scenes without Unity's asset bundle pipeline, including 
bindings for ASTC and DXT texture compression via c# with native library bindings 

● Created internal tools allowing internal artists to use the pipeline seamlessly for quick model interaction and testing. Reducing 
their iteration time by 40% 

## Unity & Engineering 

● Established internal project architecture adhering to MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles, enabling cleaner codebases and 
faster feature development 

● Created a dynamic theming system which allows any part of the app  to be changed (and hotloaded) from a document in the 
database. Which was primarily used by sales and marking to dynamically change text, feature flags for users and more. 

● Implemented a custom asset management system to replace Unity's traditional scene-based loading, increasing asset loading  
flexibility and app performance 

## Web & UI 

● Built the customer-facing UI based on designs I helped prosper using Unity’s UI Toolkit 

● Created a web-based experience editor, allowing customers to configure rooms, camera angles, and custom skies for their 
experiences 

● Developed a code-generated WebGL-C# interop library to streamline communication between Unity and JavaScript, simplifying 
WebGL platform integrations 

● Using the interop library I created bindings for Firebase, Azure Blob Storage and other services. Allowing developers to call  
them directly in c# avoiding the hassle of setting them up each time

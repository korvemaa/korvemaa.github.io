## The problem

Users wanted a way to explore Enviz spaces without installing anything.

A downloadable app created friction - slow onboarding, lost leads. We needed to provide a way to onboard leads more effectively.

## The solution

A unity webgl player that streamed Enviz spaces directly in the browser

## Technical challenges

There were loads of technical hurdles to get over whilst making the web app. Some of which still haunt me to this day.

## Lessons learned

## The impact

The web app had a huge impact on the company, both internally and externally.

* Enabled instant access to Enviz spaces from any browser.

* Reduced friction during sales demos.

* Expanded reach to customers who couldnt or wouldnt install apps like in corporate settings.

* Became one of the core entrypoints into the Enviz platform.
